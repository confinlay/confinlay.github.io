I've always loved theatre, and in my 2nd and 3rd years in college I was very active in the Trinity Musical Theatre Society. I was elected Treasurer in my 3rd year, which involved the following:

- I handled all the money stuff - keeping track of our €35,000 budget and making sure we didn't go broke
- Reached out to sponsors and secured €16,500 in funding (up 40% from the previous year) to help put on bigger and better shows
- Interviewed and selected the production teams for our shows
- Worked with the rest of the committee to keep the society running smoothly
