I'm running TES's student startup incubator program this year. It's been a really rewarding experience working with early-stage founders who are just getting started. Some highlights:

- Working closely with 14 student startup teams, helping them develop their ideas through mentorship and connecting them with people who can help
- Went through about 80 applications to pick our cohort - was tough but we found some really promising teams
- Got some great founders and startup folks from Dublin to come chat with our teams each week
- Ran a pitch competition where 6 of our most promising teams got some funding to keep building
