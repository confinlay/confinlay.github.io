I joined the student team organizing Leuven Slush'd, a startup conference that brings together founders, investors and students from across Belgium. As a volunteer, I:

- Helped set up and run the event alongside other student organizers
- Made sure speakers and startups had what they needed and knew where to go
- Pitched in wherever help was needed, from registration to venue setup
