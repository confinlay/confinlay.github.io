I worked with the "Back-end Core Components" team at Twipe, a leading European mediatech scale-up that provides a digital publishing platform to top newspapers, including The Telegraph and Le Monde. I had been studying in Belgium for the previous year, so I extended my stay over the summer for the internship. 

Having only worked in a small startup before, it was cool to work with a larger team with a widely used product. Twipe was a great size, about 60 full time employees, but with over 1 million daily users. 

Twipe was also kind enough to write a blog post about my internship. Read it [here](https://www.twipemobile.com/conor-finlay-life-as-a-summer-intern-2024-in-the-back-end-components-team/).
