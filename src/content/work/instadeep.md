Currently working on scaling up deep reinforcement learning at InstaDeep, which specialises in decision-making AI systems for enterprise applications.

In 2023, they were acquired by BioNTech, and much of their research/development goes towards applications in biotechnology. There are a lot of brilliant people here, and I'm learning a lot. My team works on distributed RL training, and I'm trying to improve my ML engineering and research skills as quickly as possible while here.

I'd really love to get involved with some research projects in my spare time, so please get in touch if you'd like to collaborate.
